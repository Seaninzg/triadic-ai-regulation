Triadic AI Regulation

Hallucination-Resistant Cognitive Architecture for Generative AI

This repository documents the patent-pending system architecture titled:

“Systems and Methods for Tension-Governed Output Regulation in Cognitive Processing Architectures”

It introduces a novel AI framework in which two divergent cognitive agents—abstraction-oriented and context-oriented—are mutually constrained by a third regulatory layer, enabling hallucination prevention through enforced non-generation.

🔍 Overview

Traditional AI systems optimize for confident outputs. This system prioritizes restraint under tension. Outputs are withheld, not corrected, when abstraction outpaces grounding or vice versa.

The system comprises:

A triadic cognitive architecture (not ensemble-based)

A regulatory control layer performing volitional gating

A user-mode counterweight module that induces productive cognitive friction (e.g., right/left-brain analogues)
